# Kalob's Jokes API

An API I created for the knock knock project in Computing 1 at IUPUI

The API will live at `jokes.kalob.net/api`

### Usage

The current endpoints are:

`GET /api/knock-kock`
`GET /api/knock-knock/:keyword`

### Contributing

This is a project that I will likely not keep up on, feel free to send a PR.
